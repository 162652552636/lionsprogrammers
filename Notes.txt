We have an issue in our project. during the sign up the user can enter his 
details but on switching to the sign page the data gets restored. We tried 
a lot but we couldn't fix this problem. We are very sorry for the issue.

So we have provided inbuilt usernames and password through which we can 
login and use the dictionary.

username=["Sravan","Mofe","Mahir","Kevin"]
password=["Sravan2022","Mofe2022","Mahir2022","Kevin2022"] 

Another issue is that we didn't add profile to the project as mentioned in the 
design(phase2). So we only created popup for logout.

To test the project please start only from "lions.html" (ignore other html files)
